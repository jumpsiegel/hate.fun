// Note: These tests are designed for manual testing with a deployed program
// Pinocchio uses different types than solana-program, making it incompatible
// with solana-program-test's direct processor testing.
//
// To test this program:
// 1. Build: cargo build-sbf
// 2. Deploy to devnet/localnet
// 3. Use client SDK to interact with deployed program
//
// For now, we'll create unit tests for the validation logic and helper functions.
